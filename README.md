# EigenFaces
The implementation of face detection using the concept of Eigenfaces. The work highlights the prospective of an OpenCV aided facial detection system. 
OpenCV is a library of functions intended for computer vision and its applications.
The aim of facial recognition is to detect faces in still images and has many methods such as local, global,and hybrid approach.
